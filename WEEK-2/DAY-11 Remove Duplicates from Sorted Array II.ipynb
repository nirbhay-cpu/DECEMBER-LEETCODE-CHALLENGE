    "QUESTION-\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that duplicates appeared at most twice and return the new length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not allocate extra space for another array; you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clarification:\n",
    "\n",
    "Confused why the returned value is an integer, but your answer is an array?\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means a modification to the input array will be known to the caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally you can think of this:\n",
    "\n",
    "// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)\n",
    "int len = removeDuplicates(nums);\n",
    "\n",
    "// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.\n",
    "// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.\n",
    "for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n",

    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]\n",
    "Output: 5, nums = [1,1,2,2,3]\n",
    "Explanation: Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]\n",
    "Output: 7, nums = [0,0,1,1,2,3,3]\n",
    "Explanation: Your function should return length = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being modified to 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively. It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.\n",
